  title: Making _scientific_ data analysis and modelling _easy_
  description: >-
    **easyScience** is a Python/QML framework for data analysis being developed
    to speed-up the time from data collection to publication. Users will be able
    to both view and model their data using a variety of popular field dependent
    engines or calculators within a friendly graphical interface or through a
    Jupyter notebooks.
  description_extra: >-
    Current success stories are for the fields of powder
    neutron diffraction and reflectometry where profiles based on user defined
    models are simulated and refinement against experimental data.
